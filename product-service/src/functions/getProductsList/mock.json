Built in steel and aluminium by Chinese yard Kingship Marine, OCEAN'S SEVEN is the fifth yacht from this yard to be designed by Vripack. New decor was recently installed throughout including designer Italian furnishings and Oriental artworks. The yacht is loaded with a fantastic collection of water toys including kayaks, paddle boards, seabobs and jetskis for the whole family to enjoy.She accommodates 10 guests in five cabins including a full beam master suite on the main deck while below are two VIP suites and two twins, each with an extra Pullman bed, all with entertainment systems and full en suite bathroom facilities.The bridge deck is particularly attractive with a sky lounge opening out onto an uncovered aft deck and a partially covered sun deck with a Jacuzzi, bar and electric barbecue. The sundeck also features a very large bar-food service counter to port, with six fixed bar stools that are comfortably far apart.Opposite, there is a large settee and sun pads forward. A drop-down TV has also been installed. Recessed lighting at the base of the bar area and the settee combined with lighting inside the Jacuzzi create a great nighttime feel. These large deck areas are perfect for al fresco relaxation, entertaining and dining.OCEAN'S SEVEN is equipped with an ultra-modern stabilization system which reduces roll motion effect and results in a smoother more enjoyable cruising experience underway. The yacht is also fitted with 'at anchor stabilizers', increasing on-board comfort when the yacht is stationary, particularly in rough waters.",
